                        <p>In my free time I love to get lost in other worlds, and the best avenue to do this for me has been Dungeons and Dragons games and being the Dungeon Master for my group. Pictured above you can see a room that I have turned into my little "Tavern" to play games in, I think it turned out great!</p>

                        <p>When the weather is nice and it's not raining up here in Washington, I enjoy hiking up near Mt. Rainier. Being out in nature and seeing amazing views is one of the few things I will actually choose to get up early for. Above is one of the photos I've taken there.</p>

                        <p>Something else I've been passionate about since I was younger is watching anime. I love the stories that can be told when you're not restricted to live action, and I've even been to Japan on a trip to visit locations featured in my favorite anime. You can see a picture from that trip above!</p>

                        <p>While I've received plenty of awards and decorations in my military career, the one that was most important to me is pictured above. It represents the last time my unit held internal "competitions" to see who was best at their respective jobs, and where all the hard work I put in every day was truly appreciated.</p>

                        <p>After that award I moved on to learn about our data links section. Over there I became even more technically competent and branched out into multiple sections of Air Defense, culminating in my promotion to Technical Sergeant. The photo above is from the day I finally earned the stripe I wear today.</p>

                        <p>Finally I have started working on my degree in earnest and pursuing certifications that will enable me for a future career outside the military. I hope to be able to empower airmen with better tools and programs, either through management or development, so I've become a Scrum Master while working on software development as well.</p>
